## Dependencies:
Developed on Ubuntu 20.04. Python dependencies in `~/environment.yml`, can be batch installed with: 

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
If package install fails, try removing specific versions in `.yml` file: e.g. if 
```
ResolvePackageNotFound: 
  - libgfortran-ng==7.5.0=hdf63c60_6
```  
change `libgfortran-ng==7.5.0=hdf63c60_6` to `libgfortran-ng=7.5.0`. 

Then:
```
conda activate dm_env
```

## Compiling:
from `~/code/cpp`:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=$(which python) -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
make
```

## Script Examples:  
Run individual problems and solvers from `~\code` by modifying `code/param.py` and then:
```
python run.py
```
Run batch examples from `~\code\tests`: 
```
python regression.py
```
Run waypoint planning from `~\code\tests`: 
```
python waypoint_planning.py
```
Train neural networks by modifying parameters in `code/train.py` then, from `~\code`:
```
python train.py
```

## Error Messages

If you get an error message such as: 

```No such file or directory: '/home/ben/projects/decision_making/saved/example9/model_value_l0.pt```

it means that the solver tried to query a neural network oracle that does not exist. You can either disable neural network search or create a new model. 

To disable the neural network search, change `oracles_on` in `param.py` to `oracles_on = False`

To create a model, run `python train.py`. After training, you can query the newly created model (in `../current/models/`) by changing the `dirname` parameter in `param.py` to the corresponding location.
